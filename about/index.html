    <p>Hi, I'm James.</p>
<p>I'm a PhD candidate investigating the construction of large-scale 3D Morphable Models under <a href="http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/people/szafeiriou">Stefanos Zafeiriou</a> in the <a href="http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/">iBUG group</a> at <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>.</p>
<p>I write <a href="https://github.com/jabooth">a lot</a> of Python code.
As part of my PhD I co-founded <a href="http://www.menpo.org/">The Menpo Project</a> with my good friends <a href="http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/people/psnape">Patrick Snape</a>, <a href="http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/people/jalabort-i-medina">Joan Alabort-i-Medina</a>, and <a href="http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/people/eantonakos">Nontas Antonakos</a>. 
Menpo is an open source, cross-platform library for training and fitting 2D and 3D deformable models.</p>
<p>I also write a fair amount of Javascript. I developed <a href="http://www.landmarker.io">landmarker.io</a> as part of my PhD, a WebGL-powered 2D and 3D annotation tool.</p>
<p>Outside of my PhD I offer software engineering and software consulting services. You can find out more details about all the projects I have been involved with on my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> page, or see my <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jabooth">LinkedIn profile</a> for a detailed professional background.</p>

### Background

I was born and raised in [Pontefract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontefract), a mining town in West Yorkshire, England.
I moved to London in 2008 to study Physics at [Imperial College](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/).
After 3 years I left the physics department with a BSc First Class Honours, and moved 150m to start an MSc in Computing in the computer science department.
I did my final year project under [Dr. Stefanos Zafeiriou](http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/people/szafeiriou), and researched the construction of Morphable Models, powerful 3D statistical models of the human face.
[My project was a success](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/computing/teaching/pg/pg-distinguished-projects/2012), and so after finishing the MSc I joined the iBUG group as a Research Associate to continue to develop the research I had started.

### PhD Research

### Python & The Menpo Project

Before taking the MSc in computing I had dabbled in programming, and read a few books, but I always felt like I was missing the bigger picture.
The MSc was the perfect course to rectify this; I left with a firm grounding in programming fundamentals.
(Seriously, if you are reading this as someone who enjoys programming and wants to master it, give some serious thought to an MSc in the subject).

I was also exposed to a bunch of languages during the course. Most of my courses involved using C++, and my project was all done in Matlab.
I liked them all, but not of them really grabbed me.

I started as an RA with a repo full of Matlab code from my MSc project, and started thinking about to refactor things to form a solid foundation to build on top of.

In doing so, I discovered that Matlab is a giant turd of a general-purpose programming language.

It's painfully obvious that Matlab was designed for interactive linear algebra work, and all subsequent language features have to be bolted on around a weak and brittle core. Don't get me wrong, for writing short scripts of linear algebra it may be the best tool going (actually, [maybe not](http://ipython.org/)) but a global namespace, poor general purpose containers, and an extremely expensive license make it a terrible job for even a moderately large project.

I started looking for an alternative, and quickly found that Python was a commonly cited
